Question 1
    What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
    const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
    clothes.length = 0;
    console.log(clothes[0]);
    => Output: undefined.
    => Reason: when we assigned 0 to array length it shrinks deleting all its elements. SO when we try to access there is no element in the array.
