Q1. By how many ways we can access elements in the DOM and write about them in brief?
=> We can access elements by 3 ways
1. by id
   Id id unique for every element and it manipulates with properties of single element only.
   we use "document.getElementById("id-name");" to access the elements by id. 
2. by class name
    Class can be collectively given to some tags and operations will be implied to all that tags.
    we use "document.getElementsByClassName("class-name");" to access elements by class name.
3. by tag name
    By using tag name to access we can select all the elemnts with the same tag name and apply changes to them all simaltaneously.
    we use "document.getElementsByTagName("tag-name");" to get elements by tag name.
